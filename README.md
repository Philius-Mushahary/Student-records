The Student Records application programmed in C language is used to store manually entered data of multiple students in a .txt file.
The .txt file can later be viewed with all the respective details of all students mentioned by the user.
Simply run the application and an interface will open in cmd prompt.
Enter the total number of student entries you want to make.
Then type out all students' details one by one.
After the total entries are complete, a .txt file will be made in the same folder with the Student records.
Each time you open the application, the memory in the .txt file is erased (i.e. New record is made).
